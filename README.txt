This project was previously available from our http://www.embedded-code.com source code store (owned by IBEX UK Ltd) and is a fully packaged and documented project.  After several years selling these source code projects to developers we took the decision to finally open source all of the projects hosted on the site.

The projects original page on the embedded-code.com web site can be found at: http://www.embedded-code.com/source-code/memory/compact-flash-memory-cards/compact-flash-memory-card-fat16-fat32-driver

This project was superseded by the SD Card driver we have also open sourced.  In theory the mem-ffs.c and mem-ffs.h files could be replaced from the files for the SD Card project with some gains from the functionality added to the SD Card project, however this needs testing to ensure there are no issues which need resolving.  The projects started out with interchangeable mem-ffs files so it’s likely to be fine, but it’s not guaranteed something didn't get broken between the projects.
